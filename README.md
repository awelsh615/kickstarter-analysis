# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project  
An analysis of kickstarter data to uncover trends for theater (play) campaigns based on funding goal and also launch date.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to answer two questions for a specific subset of kickstarter campaigns (namely theater projects with an emphasis on plays):
1. Does the month that a campaign is launched affect how successful the kickstarter is?
2. Does the initial funding goal affect how successful the kickstarter is?
### Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
